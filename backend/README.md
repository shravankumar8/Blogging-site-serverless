## Introduction
This project implements a serverless backend using [Hono](https://honojs.dev/) and [Cloudflare Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/). Hono is a lightweight, fast, and modular framework for building web applications and APIs, while Cloudflare Workers provide a scalable, serverless execution environment at the edge.

## Architecture
The backend is built using a serverless architecture, leveraging Cloudflare Workers for running code without managing servers. This approach provides several benefits:
- Scalability: Automatically scales with the traffic.
- Cost Efficiency: Pay only for the resources you use.
- Low Latency: Runs close to the users, reducing latency.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed.
- A Cloudflare account.
- [Wrangler CLI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/get-started/) installed.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/shravankumar8/Blogging-site-serverless.git
   cd Blogging-site-serverless 
    npm install
    npm run dev
    npm run deploy


    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
